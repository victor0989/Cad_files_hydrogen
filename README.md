Simplified CAD design of a satellite engine
Design: It's a green fuel tank rocket
I want to keep exploring options at this stage
of the design and regarding green hydrogen-ammonia technology
I've seen a more robust structure for a green rocket
for space. We could use hydrogen, ammonia, and plasma with LOX.
I want to design more robust structures similar to this (using polymesh images) but as compartments for spacecraft. These are special rockets or spacecraft that require research into ammonia or hydrogen before investing money. We would need to calculate where to use it effectively and build simple ammonia plants, as well as thermal systems and simple electrolysis for small hydrogen components.
